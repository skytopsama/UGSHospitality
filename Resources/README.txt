There are a lot of files here. Everything in the LEGACY folder is older development stuff that may not be current code to look at.

THE BEST way to see all of the parts of an edoc is to pull everything from PRD.
The parts you will need:
- Doctype
- EDL
- Rules
- Groups
- Rule Attributes
- Rule Templates
- EmailInitiator Styles
- Groups
And the two special files that are already in PRD/REG that our edocs use:
- UGS.Notes.Styles
- Ugs-Widgets-bootstrap-style 

Some files in here show documentation of testing. Now you should use JIRA, not just document it in a Word file!

The things i have most recently been working on, where i am updating edocs to newer versions or developing new things completely is 
under the folder NewDevelopment. However some of this information is reflected on Github under the ugsedocs repository found here:
https://github.iu.edu/ugsedocs?tab=repositories

I recommend using Github to organize your code and be able to work on it offsite.
